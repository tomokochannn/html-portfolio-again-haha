<h1>The Best Movies of all time</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>My Neighbour Totoro</h3>
<p>The coziest movie for me. Any ghibli movie would do actually but this is my favourite!</p>
<h3>The Devils Wear Prada</h3>
<p>I just love how 'Emily' works. Hardworks never betray.</p>
<h3>Welcome to Samdalri</h3>
<p>Another cozy Kdrama. Maybe I love how the girl (main character) never give up on her dreams to pursue photography.</p>
<br>
<p> So, feel free to watch! It's good tho.</p>
